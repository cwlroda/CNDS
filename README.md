## RMI vs UDP
This project compares the differences between the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) methods for server-client communications. Messages are sent by a client and received on a server via a common network. The number of lost messages are then tallied and serve as an explanation of the various factors that affect message reception. View the pdf report for obtained findings.
